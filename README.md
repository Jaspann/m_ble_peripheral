# m_ble_peripheral

A modified version of k_ble_peripheral with ios support. Original project by Keysking: https://github.com/keysking/k_ble_peripheral

## Getting Started

This project should be a direct replacement for k_ble_peripheral. All files share the exact same names, so no modification should be necessary to use this package other then adding this package and removing k_ble. 

This is not heavily tested. The features were written as they were needed for another project I am working on. Due to this, I am not currently planning to merge this back with k_ble_peripheral. Do not expect the code to work for your specific use case.
